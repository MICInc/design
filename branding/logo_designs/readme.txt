Some ideas for the logo: 
- Wanted to communicate the idea of connections, both in the literal as well as metaphorical sense. 
- Color scheme is TBD
- Font choices: Futura or Avenir, both are geometric sans serifs that have strong associations with futurism, modernism, efficiency etc 
- Feedback extremely welcome! As well as more creative ideas. 
- Once an idea has been chosen, I will go back into illustrator to clean up the drawings.
